A scalable physics engine implemented with JAX. With JIT batteries üîã

.. warning::
   This project is still experimental, APIs could change without notice. Ô∏è‚ö†

.. warning::
   This simulator currently focuses on locomotion applications. Only contacts with ground are supported. Ô∏è‚ö†

Features
--------

- Physics engine in reduced coordinates implemented with `JAX`_ in Python.
- Supported JIT compilation of Python code for increased performance.
- Transparent support to execute the simulation on CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs.
- Possibility to run parallel multi-body simulations on hardware accelerators for significantly increased throughput.
- Support of SDF models (and, upon conversion, URDF models).
- Collision detection between bodies and uneven ground surface.
- Continuous soft contacts model with no friction cone approximations.
- Full support of inertial properties of bodies.
- Revolute, prismatic, and fixed joints support.
- Integrators: forward Euler, semi-implicit Euler, Runge-Kutta 4.
- High-level classes to compute multi-body dynamics quantities from simulation state.
- High-level classes supporting both object-oriented and functional programming.
- Optional validation of JAX pytrees to prevent JIT re-compilation. 

Planned features:

- Reinforcement Learning module developed in JAX.
- Finalization of differentiable physics through the simulation.

Installation
------------

You can install the project with `pypa/pip`_, preferably in a `virtual environment`_:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install jaxsim

Have a look to `setup.cfg`_ for a complete list of optional dependencies.
You can install all of them by specifying ``jaxsim[all]``.

**Note:** if you need GPU support, please follow the official `installation instruction`_ of JAX.

Credits
-------

The physics module of JAXsim is based on the theory of the `Rigid Body Dynamics Algorithms`_ book authored by Roy Featherstone.
We structured part of our logic following its accompanying `code`_.
The physics engine is developed entirely in Python using `JAX`_.

.. _Rigid Body Dynamics Algorithms: https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4899-7560-7
.. _code: http://royfeatherstone.org/spatial/index.html#spatial-software

The inspiration of developing JAXsim stems from `google/brax`_.
Here below we summarize the differences between the projects:

- JAXsim simulates multibody dynamics in reduced coordinates, while `brax` uses maximal coordinates.
- The rigid body algorithms used in JAXsim allow to efficiently compute quantities based on the Euler-Poincar√®
  formulation of the equations of motion, necessary for model-based robotics research.
- JAXsim supports SDF (and, indirectly, URDF) models, under the assumption that the model is described with the
  recent `Pose Frame Semantics`_.
- Contrarily to `brax`, JAXsim only supports collision detection between bodies and a compliant ground surface.
- While supported thanks to the usage of JAX, differentiating through the simulator has not yet been studied.
