Credits
-------

The physics module of JAXsim is based on the theory of the `Rigid Body Dynamics Algorithms <https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4899-7560-7>`_ book by Roy Featherstone.
We structured part of our logic following its accompanying `code <http://royfeatherstone.org/spatial/index.html#spatial-software>`_.
The physics engine is developed entirely in Python using JAX_.

The inspiration for developing JAXsim originally stemmed from early versions of Brax_.
Here below we summarize the differences between the projects:

- JAXsim simulates multibody dynamics in reduced coordinates, while :code:`brax v1` uses maximal coordinates.
- The new v2 APIs of brax (and the new MJX_) were then implemented in reduced coordinates, following an approach comparable to JAXsim, with major differences in contact handling.
- The rigid-body algorithms used in JAXsim allow to efficiently compute quantities based on the Euler-Poincarè
  formulation of the equations of motion, necessary for model-based robotics research.
- JAXsim supports SDF (and, indirectly, URDF) models, assuming the model is described with the
  recent `Pose Frame Semantics <http://sdformat.org/tutorials?tut=pose_frame_semantics>`_.
- Contrarily to brax, JAXsim only supports collision detection between bodies and a compliant ground surface.
- The RBDAs of JAXsim support automatic differentiation, but this functionality has not been thoroughly tested.
